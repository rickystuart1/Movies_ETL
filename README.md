## Overview
The purpose of this project is to clean data that has been provided to us and prepare it for a hackathon event, so several teams can use this data for their projects. 
We cleaned the data using the ETL method (Extract, Transform, and Load). Then loaded the clean data into a postgres database to be accessed from there by hackathon participants.
